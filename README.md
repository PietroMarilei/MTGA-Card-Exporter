## Features
- Extract card IDs and quantities from MTGA log files
- Convert card IDs to card names using AllPrintings.json
- Export results to CSV files
- User-friendly graphical interface

## Requirements and Installation
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- Internet connection to download AllPrintings.json (if not already available)

To install:
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. No additional dependencies are required.

## Usage
1. Run the script: `python mtga_collection_exporter.py`
2. Use the GUI to select your MTGA log file (usually named "UTC_Log-*.log").
3. Select the AllPrintings.json file (download from MTGJSON if you don't have it).
4. Click "Extract Card IDs" to get a CSV of card IDs and quantities.
5. Click "Convert to Card Names" to get a CSV with card names included.

## File Locations
- MTGA Log Files: 
  - Windows (Steam version): `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MTGA\MTGA_Data\Logs\Logs`
    The file is named `UTC_Log - [date].log`
  - Windows (Standard version): `%appdata%/../LocalLow/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA`
- AllPrintings.json: Download from [MTGJSON](https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/)

## Output and Troubleshooting
The application generates two types of CSV files:
1. `deck_card_ids_[timestamp].csv`: Contains card IDs and quantities
2. `deck_card_names_[timestamp].csv`: Contains card IDs, names, and quantities

If card names are not found, ensure you're using the latest version of AllPrintings.json. Check the console output for additional debugging information.
